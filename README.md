BashMusicPlayer
===============
Just invoke the install script

###### It's just a simple music player that provides the user with the latest music from any site (as long as it contains MP3 files) provided in the settings file. It can play it, download it and has a simple settings file from which the user can add/change sites or change the default music player used for playing music. It was first created as a simple bash script to play music to keep me focused while learning programming, but it eventually became a self-contained music program.
